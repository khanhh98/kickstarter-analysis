# Kickstarter-analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
	- The purpose of this analysis is to help Louise to analyze and better understand the outcome of Kickstarter campaigns based on the initiate date as well as funding goal.

## Analysis and Challenges
	- The analysis has multiple graphs which is drawn from provided data. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
	- For this particular part of analysis, I created a pivot table to count the outcome of the campaigns (either failed, canceled or failed) based on the launch date.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
	- For this part, we created another sheet to count the numbers of outcome campaign with different funding goal range using countifs formula. Then, we find the percentage of successful/failed/Canceled and used that data we found to draw a line chart. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
	- The most challenge part of this assignment is making sure to use the right data ( filtered data such as "play", "theater"). Also, how to put data into the right filter in pivot table in order to get the right data point for the graphs.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
	- Based on the line chart for the Outcomes based on Launch Date, the most successful month for theater campaign is around May. And the worst month to launch a theater campaign is December.
	- The amount of successful/ failed outcomes are proportional to each other in which more successful campaigns will also come with more failed campaigns.
	- Therefore, it is better to launch the campaign around fall and beginning summer season to enhance the outcome. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
	- Based on the chart, I can conclude that the funding goal can affect the outcome percentage greatly.
	- The campaigns tend to do well at the first range of goal ( in which is less than 1000) and start declining when the funding goals increase ( especially down to 20 percent with 25,000 to 29,999 goal range). The successful rate climbs back to around 60 percent in 35,000 to 45,000 and dropping to near 0 when the funding goal is more than 45,000.
	- Hence, we can conclude that in order to build a successful campaign Louise should set the funding goal to be around 20,000 to 40,000 in which we will see the optimal result.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
	-Some limitations for the dataset is that we only have few variables to consider the result in the analysis. Therefore, with more data points other than funding goal, outcome we will have a more concrete graph to confirm our analysis. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
	- We can also look how the backers, average donations change with the outcome result. Hence, we can have a graph with more data point to consider our analysis
